## 💡 What I Learned

Integrating a real-time chat system like CometChat into a custom UI required careful handling of props, permissions, and SDK events. This assignment helped me:

- Understand component-based architecture of the UI Kit
- Learn how to override and conditionally render features using context
- Improve my debugging and component state management skills in React

---

## 📌 Suggestions for Improvement

Here are a few suggestions that might improve the CometChat UI Kit experience:

1. **Block Status Clarity**  
   A clearer SDK method or flag to check and update block/unblock status would be helpful.

2. **Error Messaging**  
   Better in-built error messages or hooks for common HTTP issues like `403` would improve DX.

3. **UI Customization**  
   Exposing more theme options (colors, sizes, fonts) via props would make styling more flexible.

4. **WebSocket Behavior**  
   During local dev, issues like `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` should be better handled if the dev server is down.

## 📩 Submission Notes

- The app is tested with CometChat and works with user and group messaging.
